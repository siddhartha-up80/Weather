# Weather App

The Weather App is a simple and intuitive application that allows users to check real-time weather information for various cities. By utilizing the OpenWeather API, this app provides accurate and up-to-date weather data. In addition to the weather details, the app have search box, enabling users to easily search for specific cities and retrieve weather information.

## Features

I have implemented several features to enhance the functionality and user experience of the Weather App:

1. Real-time City Weather: You can search for any city and instantly get access to the latest weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather.

2. Search Box: I have integrated a search box within the app to make it effortless for you to find weather details for your desired city. Simply type in the name of the city, and the app will fetch the weather information for that location.

3. Dynamic Background Wallpaper: To make the app visually appealing and immersive, I have integrated the Unsplash API. It automatically fetches relevant images based on the current weather conditions and sets them as the background wallpaper. This way, the app adapts its appearance to match the mood of the weather.
